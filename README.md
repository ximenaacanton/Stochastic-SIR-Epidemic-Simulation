## Introduction
This project simulates the spread of an infectious disease within a closed population using the SIR model, enhanced with stochastic processes and spatial dynamics. By solving differential equations, it provides insights into infection patterns over time and space, supporting better understanding of epidemic behaviors.

## Scope of Functionalities
- **Basic SIR Model Simulation**: Tracks susceptible, infected, and recovered cases using differential equations.
- **Stochastic Dynamics**: Incorporates randomness in population movement and disease transmission.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Simulates spatial contagion patterns among individuals in a closed population.
- **Progressive Simulations**: Includes multiple stages, each building on the previous, to model complex epidemic dynamics.

## Examples of Use
- **Analyze Epidemic Behavior**: Visualize how diseases spread temporally and spatially in a controlled environment.
- **Experiment with Interventions**: Modify parameters (e.g., infection rate, recovery rate) to simulate the impact of interventions.
- **Understand Stochastic Effects**: Study how random movement affects infection curves and outcomes.
